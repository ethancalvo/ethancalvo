- 👋 Hi, I’m @ethancalvo
- 👀 I’m interested in solving world problems with html, css, and javascript - no libraries. :)
  - ALSO, I love endurance sports. Need help with a triathlon club page or ultra marathon site or marathon swim app? Please hit me up.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data/content modeling within Sanity.io and mongoDB - the whole atlas realm thing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on self-sustaining projects that serve the community.
- 📫 How to reach me: leave a comment in the github.
